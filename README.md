# Info Final Project: Global CO2 and People's Effects
Hi, this is the INFO 201 Final Project Team! 

In this R project, we take a look at the global average co2 intake from the years 1990 to 2021 and compare it with the global populations from the years 1990 to 2021. This is an analysis
of the human effects on climate change through the use of CO2.

The main csv file we used is the global_avg_data.csv

We will incoparte the use of the UI, shiny, to storytell our findings.
