# final-projects-p1nsr
Hi, this the INFO 201 Final Project Team! 

In this R project, we take a look at the global average co2 intake from the years 1995 to 2021 and compare it with the global populations from the years 1995 to 2021. 

We filtered the co2 dataset to only find the means of the global co2 per year and merged this dataframe with population dataframe by YEAR.
